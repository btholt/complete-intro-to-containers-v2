Many reasons! Let&#39;s make our Node.js app a bit more complicated. What if it had a database? Let&#39;s connect it to a running MongoDB database. We <em>could</em> start this MongoDB database inside of the same container and this might be fine for development on the smallest app but it&#39;d be better and easier if we could just use the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo\">mongo</a> container directly. But if I have two containers running at the same time (the app containers and the MongoDB container) how do they talk to each other? Networking!</p>\n<p>There are several ways of doing networking within Docker and all of them work differently depending which operating system you&#39;re on. Again, this is a deep subject and we&#39;re just going to skim the surface. We&#39;re going to deal with the simplest, the bridge networks. There is a default bridge network running all the time. If you want to check this out, run <code>docker network ls</code>. You&#39;ll see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\">$ docker network <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">ls</span>\nNETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE\nxxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge              <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">local</span>\nxxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host                <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">local</span>\nxxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null                <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">local</span>\n</code></pre><p>The bridge network is the one that exists all the time and we could attach to it if we want to, but again Docker recommends against it so we&#39;ll create our own. There&#39;s also the host network which is the host computer itself&#39;s network. The last network with the <code>null</code> driver is one that you&#39;d use if you wanted to use some other provider or if you wanted to do it manually yourself.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># create the network</span>\ndocker network create --driver=bridge app-net\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"># start the mongodb server</span>\ndocker run -d --network=app-net -p 27017:27017 --name=db --<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">rm</span> mongo:7\n</code></pre><p>I&#39;m having you run a specific version of MongoDB, v7, because I know the package to interact with it is already available on Ubuntu. Feel free to use v8+ if you know it&#39;s available. We also added a few flags. The <code>--name</code> flag allows us to refer specifically to that one running container, and even better it allows us to use that as its address on the network. We&#39;ll see that in a sec. The one other, since we&#39;re using <code>--name</code> is <code>--rm</code>. If we didn&#39;t use that, we&#39;d have to run <code>docker rm db</code> before restarting our <code>db</code> container since when it stops a container, it doesn&#39;t delete it and its logs and meta data until you tell it to. The <code>--rm</code> means toss all that stuff as soon as the container finishes and free up that name again.</p>\n<p>Now, for fun we can use <em>another</em> MongoDB containter (because it has the <code>mongosh</code> client on it in addition to have the MongoDB server).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\">docker run -it --network=app-net --<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">rm</span> mongo:7 mongosh --host db\n</code></pre><p>This will be one instance of a MongoDB container connecting to a different container over our Docker network.
