The default Ubuntu container doesn't have Node.js installed. Let's use a different container!\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it node:20\n```\n\nThe version here is we're using is Node.js version 20. If you run this as-is, it'll drop you directly into Node.js. What version of Linux do you think this is? Let's find out!\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it node:20 cat /etc/issue\n```\n\nIt's Debian!
