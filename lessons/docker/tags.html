Let's try another one.\n\n```bash\ndocker run node:20-alpine cat /etc/issue\n```\n\nYou'll see this is running an entirely different OS all together: Alpine! [Alpine Linux][alpine] is a very, very tiny distro of Linux made for containers and specifically because it is tiny. Alpine containers are bare bones: if you want _anything_ in them, you're going to have to do it yourself. This is in opposition to the Ubuntu and Debian containers: they ship the kitchen sink with them which is both convenient and much bigger in size. Alpine images are about five megabytes whereas Ubuntu is close to two hundred megabytes. As you can imagine, this can make a difference in how fast you can deploy and can cost significantly less in terms of storage and network traffic. It's also in general better to have less unnecessary things in your containers: less is more in terms of security. If an attacker tries to execute a Python exploit on your container but your container doesn't have Python then their attack won't work.\n\nWe'll get more into how to ship containers to production but I'll leave you with this pro-tip: have a development container which has all the bells, whistles, debugging tools, etc. that you need. Then have a production container that's minimalist as possibly can be. You'll get the best of both worlds.\n\n[node]: https://hub.docker.com/_/node/\n[alpine]: https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine\n","slug":"tags","title":"Tags","section":"Docker","icon":"fish","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-containers-v2/complete-intro-to-containers-v2/lessons/03-docker/D-tags.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/docker/docker-cli","prevSlug":"/lessons/docker/javascript-on-docker"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/lessons/[section]/[slug]","query":{"section":"docker","slug":"tags"},"buildId":"nARcRKX1ZlcrYUdSUSS9z","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
